              Hi, I am Dipika Shrestha and this is my Professional Portfolio. I was born and raised in Nepal. I moved to the USA and now residing in Saint Paul, Minnesota. I like to travel to new places.
              I have two pugs named Oreo and Haku. Oreo is a fawn color, he is three years old. Haku is black in color, he is close to a year old now. 
              They are so cute as well as naughty.
              <br />
              <br />
              
              I am interested in software development and want to build a career out of it. Therefore, I am enrolled in
              the full-stack bootcamp program hosted by EdEx through University of Minnesota.
              <br />

            <p>
              In this project, I worked on improving the code for a webpage of a
              marketing agency, Horiseon, so that it meets the accessibility
              standards. To accomplish the task, I updated and refactored the
              existing code, such that elements followed a logical structure
              independent of styling and positioning, the image elements had
              accessible 'alt' attributes, the heading attributes followed a
              sequetial order and the title was concise and descriptive.

              Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. 
              Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, 
              but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts,
              recent advancements, and new technologies.This project is a CMS-style blog site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developer's posts as well.
